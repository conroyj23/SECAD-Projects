### Repository Information

This repository includes two projects:
	1.) A Chat Client written in JavaScript, and a Chat Server written in Go. The user can send public messages, private messages, return the current userlist, and disconnect.
	
	2.) A website form page and index page both written in PHP. The form page requires a username and password and verifies these inputs against a SQL database. Upon successful login, the user is sent to the index page. This program implements anti SQL Injection and XSS safety measures.
